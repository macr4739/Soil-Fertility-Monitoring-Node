The Soil Fertility Monitoring Node is a sensor-based embedded system designed to monitor key soil parameters that directly influence crop productivity. <br> The project employs the STM32F446ZE microcontroller as the central controller to acquire, process, and display soil data in real-time The system integrates a DS18B20 temperature probe to measure soil temperature and a soil moisture sensor to monitor water content in the soil, both of which are crucial indicators of soil fertility and plant health. An OLED display is used to provide a compact and user-friendly interface for visualizing the collected data.
